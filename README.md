This project used React, HTML, SCSS, Javascript, Python and Flask in order to to create a webpage with information on some people, planets and vehicles which can be found in the starwars universe. This project fetches information from a backend api which ,I created in another project in order to populate the front-end with information on the people, planets and vechiles. This project utilizated the .Map() function that javascript has to create the cards which contained the information on the three things I stated eariler. The styling of the cards mostly ultized bootstrap. 
This project also used event listners in order to make a favorites list for each user.
